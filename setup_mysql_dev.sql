-- Prepares a MySQL server with the following:
-- Creates a database hbnb_dev_db if it doesn't exist
-- Creates a new user hbnb_dev (in localhost) if it doesn't exist
-- The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
-- hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
-- hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hbnb_dev_db;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'hbnb_dev_pwd';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `hbnb_dev_db`.* TO 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON `performance_schema`.* TO 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
